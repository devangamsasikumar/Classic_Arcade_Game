## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

# Cloning of the Project

1.  First we need to clone the project from the udacity blog.
2.  After that we need to read all the files of given arcade game.
3.  Now we need to make the changes only in the app.js file.
4.  then the following steps are to be followed.

## Procedure to create the arcade game

1.  In the index file we need to add lang, meta tag.After that we need to resolve
    some errors in app.js file by running the index file in console.
2.  After resolving the errors we get the canvas of the arcade game.
3.  Then we need to add the player charecter and after that we need to
    add enemy charecter in a loop for movement,after that we need to give random
    movement to the enemies by using Math.random() function.
4.  Then we need to give the movement to the player using arrow keys.
5.  after that we need to write the checkCollision() method to go to the initial position.
6.  After colliding with the enemies and top-layer of the canvas the player should come to the initial position.

### Conclusion

1.  From this project I have learned how to use the object oriented JavaScript.
2.  I learnt how to implement the objects and functions.
3.  I have learnt different ES6 functionalities.
